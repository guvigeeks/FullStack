Day 1

Hardware Intro
Explain What is hardware to Students. Basic components of Computer Hardware like Hard Disk,RAM,Processor should be explained. The role of these components in computing should be explained. Mentors should give some physical examples of Images of the components.

Full Stack Development 
Mentors should explain the overview of what they are going to learn in these 3 months. Many real time examples and Case studies should be introduced in this session (Zomoto,Swiggy,Facebook,Instagram,Ola,Uber etc..)

Client
Mentors should explain what is client side devices and make students think what are all the client devices they came across in their daily life..  (Browser,Mobile,Smart TV,SmartWatch,Pos devices,Smart car Dashboard, Google glass etc..)

Server
Mentors should explain the role of servers in the fullstack development. Clarify that there are many server side programming languages available. Duty of the server is to receive the request and connect DB and process the data and response to the client. Give real examples like facebook is using PHP and Netflix is Using Nodejs and Python.

Database
Mentor should explain that Database is the storage warehouse. Explain that there are two types of DB available. Structured Database and non-structured database. Give examples of MySQL and Mongodb.Show the example query of SQL and MongoDB Structure. Give realtime examples of which like Facebook is using MySqL and Netflix is using MongoDB and Uber is using both databases for storing different datas.

What is a programming Language?
A programming language is a type of written language that tells computers what to do in order to work. Programming languages are used to make all the computer programs and computer software. ... Usually, the programming language uses real words for some of the commands, so that the language is easier for a human to read.

Low level Programing Language
1’s and 0’s are called assembly languages are considered low-level because they are very close to machine languages.

High Level Programing Language

What is Javascript?
JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it. As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model
Mentor should explain all these key words and also give some intro about JS-engine
Imperative programming

Advantage
  Very simple to implement
  It contains loops, variables etc.

Disadvantage
  Complex problem cannot be solved
  Less efficient and less productive
  Parallel programming is not possible
  
  
Examples
  Example
  C
  Fortran
  Basic

Object oriented programming

Advantage
  Data security
  Inheritance
  Code reusability
  Flexible and abstraction is also present

Example
  Java 
  C++
  Python
  Ruby

Functional programming

The functional programming paradigm has its roots in mathematics and it is language independent. The key principle of this paradigm is the execution of a series of mathematical functions.
